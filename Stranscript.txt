[00:00]  And if you didn't receive any notification then failure notification is good and sometimes if you get, you can have someone to...
[00:09]  I kept a failure notification, like model failure notification, I have not kept it as monitoring.
[00:16]  It would be like, you know, calling out monitoring session.
[00:19]  But if it is happening this regular, I'll keep a strength wise thing.
[00:23]  Right now, like for example, if you call this as a bug, then only I go ahead and reset.
[00:30]  If you want to go in that way or if you want to keep a continuous monitoring story for three sprints, I'll keep like that.
[00:38]  Yeah, I think continuous monitoring will be good. Otherwise, yeah, we will...
[00:44]  Sometimes we'll check, we'll have a certain notification but no one in our team will pick and even we'll forget to check the location.
[00:53]  We'll do that. I'll keep like that.
[01:01]  Yes, I know what to do about it.
[01:03]  Yeah, I'll just strategy one, right?
[01:06]  So I pinged Antonia, he had to replay once he replayed, I will let you do it.
[01:11]  Yeah, yeah, please let me do it.
[01:13]  Yeah, 8th one, I've started the analysis with 50.
[01:17]  So right now we can see more PC keys are available in comparison to the check we did last time.
[01:22]  But still someone was saying, I'll group it as you had asked based on whether...
[01:28]  Yeah, pick a specific dealer.
[01:31]  If you want, I can give you a dealer code and serial number prefix that I used for analysis last time.
[01:40]  So you can start with that.
[01:43]  But you understood what needs to be done, right?
[01:46]  Yeah.
[01:47]  So I hope you added the description in the story and the acceptance criteria.
[01:52]  But anyways, print is ending today.
[01:54]  So start working on it.
[01:57]  I think it may move to the next print also since you just began it today.
[02:02]  That's fine.
[02:03]  But I'll share some sample dealer code and serial number prefix to do.
[02:09]  Like there will be some manual one-to-one matching.
[02:11]  So between after market prediction process and bomb,
[02:15]  we need to compare all the key columns based on which the PCP is calculated.
[02:21]  Conference group, serial number prefix, body, PWC in that particular column.
[02:29]  So usually the issue will happen in the conference group and PWC only mainly.
[02:35]  Other columns will not create an issue.
[02:39]  So these two only we had to check.
[02:42]  I'll check them.
[02:43]  Yeah.
[02:44]  I'll pin you the dealer code and serial number prefix combo.
[02:50]  10th one, I'm adding the comments.
[02:52]  I'll tag them and close it today.
[02:55]  Tag them and close it.
[02:58]  10 check case, yeah.
[02:59]  46th one, give them a statement.
[03:01]  He says, okay, I'll close it quickly.
[03:03]  And 47th one, I'm going to close that also.
[03:06]  And yesterday we had a call with Alex and Demian.
[03:10]  They said the parity ones we'll have to remove.
[03:13]  They'll pick that story up in the next print.
[03:15]  And let us do it.
[03:17]  Okay.
[03:19]  Yesterday those folders have to do that.
[03:21]  Can any of these guys can do in this way?
[03:24]  There is no hurry on that, right?
[03:26]  They will at least understand.
[03:31]  On this thing, we can give one of these stories to in turn,
[03:36]  remove parity stories from it.
[03:39]  It's just an activity, but they'll get an idea how to do it.
[03:45]  No, no, can you fix?
[03:46]  Sorry, I didn't follow the phone conversation.
[03:48]  So during when Demian was working on this lens equipment,
[03:52]  he has created a lot of parity.
[03:55]  We don't need that.
[03:57]  This is a clean up activity.
[03:59]  So if we can assign it to one of the...
[04:02]  Yeah, we can do that.
[04:04]  And Amelia was also mentioning about the list of software
[04:09]  extremely dashboards.
[04:10]  I think per head, she had like three or four.
[04:14]  So I hope that they are in a very comfortable position right
[04:20]  now.
[04:21]  I see multiple sessions being going on.
[04:23]  So we can add stories for those as well.
[04:27]  Yeah, I think at that point, they didn't have snowflake access
[04:31]  and that was urgent from their engine side.
[04:33]  So I had to finish at 30.
[04:36]  Is anything else left for them to work on?
[04:40]  From that point.
[04:42]  Okay, then we can place their help for this parity.
[04:47]  This is one.
[04:50]  And is there any dashboard upcoming?
[04:53]  So these ways, can you not get hands-on on creating stringed dashboards?
[04:59]  Even if it is smaller, you can give this for a trial as well.
[05:03]  That's what you find.
[05:04]  Just think about it.
[05:05]  In addition, the agent thing, I have to take a look at it,
[05:09]  come up with ideas so she's working on that.
[05:12]  Maybe we can add a story for that.
[05:15]  Agent thing, right?
[05:16]  Yeah.
[05:18]  Have you worked on this?
[05:24]  Yeah, always.
[05:26]  Or agent has you?
[05:27]  I took the vision track for that purpose.
[05:29]  I didn't work on it.
[05:30]  I wouldn't be allowed over here.
[05:32]  I started with a normal one.
[05:38]  Using agent like simple thing.
[05:41]  The question, it will leave a flag.
[05:45]  I won't think.
[05:52]  See, and the other team has worked on using line and chain.
[05:55]  You can connect two persons as well.
[06:01]  The other team, they were used to, they used to report from early.
[06:04]  API is it.
[06:13]  But again, you need to check.
[06:21]  At this point, we thought,
[06:22]  Deity also told us to create a demo.
[06:24]  You can just copy it, get it.
[06:26]  Not even Cortex.
[06:27]  Once we have a demo ready and it is fine,
[06:29]  we can go ahead and get access for Cortex.
[06:32]  Ortes, we don't have trial version?
[06:35]  No, no, we don't have.
[06:38]  We need to submit a use case to get the smallest to that host access.
[06:42]  E.T. to P.E. chain is already gone in all satellite streams.
[06:53]  After market prediction and other process,
[06:55]  I'll make the change to that.
[06:58]  Maybe story in next print for you.
[07:00]  We can make this a bit earlier.
[07:02]  Because as those, there will be...
[07:04]  What are the timings?
[07:06]  What time?
[07:07]  How much time we have to do all the changes?
[07:09]  It is already gone.
[07:10]  It's already whatever...
[07:11]  So that our process won't...
[07:13]  Whatever is the daily ones based on the care
[07:17]  and whatever is happening every day,
[07:19]  we'll just change that.
[07:20]  Equipment...
[07:21]  But for you, equipment and prediction was...
[07:24]  Yeah, that we can do later.
[07:26]  Auxiliary, automatic prediction, prediction repair.
[07:29]  And maybe, I don't know,
[07:31]  Lens inside BI is our identification.
[07:33]  They usually like to check there.
[07:34]  Lens BI?
[07:36]  Tarun hasn't.
[07:38]  I kept it for him because nobody is giving me date.
[07:41]  Not even 2TM is giving me date later.
[07:45]  They are going to go to hell, nobody is giving me date.
[07:47]  So it went all right.
[07:48]  Yeah.
[07:58]  Do we get error?
[08:03]  Not typically.
[08:05]  We decide conditions, right?
[08:06]  It would always be false now, since that pattern is not matching.
[08:09]  So we have a date on us.
[08:10]  We have a date on us.
[08:11]  We make that change before 2 days in a match.
[08:15]  Yeah.
[08:17]  This is for you as well, right?
[08:19]  Yeah.
[08:22]  It's for product.
[08:23]  Product?
[08:24]  Yeah.
[08:25]  Product.
[08:27]  Yeah, I don't know about, would it appear in, but he has to...
[08:34]  Product has to be changed.
[08:35]  Product has to be changed.
[08:37]  He also used some cat equipment.
[08:39]  So we updated the view accordingly.
[08:41]  At this moment, he has to update it.
[08:44]  Oh, code he has to update.
[08:46]  Tarun, you got it, right?
[08:50]  What needs to change?
[08:52]  Yeah.
[08:53]  Tarun?
[08:54]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[08:56]  Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.
[08:57]  Means look into that.
[08:58]  So we want people to come back.
[09:00]  Means we were proactive and we do that.
[09:05]  Yeah, right.
[09:07]  So the 45% we need to get up through the 100%
[09:12]  Analysis thing can come and help you on the shape and history.
[09:29]  He has some bandwidth.
[09:34]  Yeah, he started it.
[09:37]  He knows how to work it.
[09:39]  No, no, no.
[09:40]  Can come and pick it up.
[09:42]  He has some bandwidth as well.
[09:44]  Yeah.
[09:45]  Basically, we need to decide an approach.
[09:49]  It's not an MWA, definitely.
[09:52]  So we need to find the different level of service.
[09:55]  Maybe I can complete that.
[09:57]  I'll create the diagram and get them.
[10:03]  And then I'll give it to team documentation.
[10:10]  Hey, hi, Dutty.
[10:11]  I believe this will also...
[10:15]  No, for the current sprint,
[10:18]  the order number 7 has been completed.
[10:21]  But a follow-up story will be there from experience.
[10:24]  I'll give it for 57.
[10:26]  It's only about modifying filters that I can complete.
[10:29]  But I will be started on the model tuning,
[10:32]  which I think you have added from experience.
[10:35]  So I'll close it by update.
[10:43]  It's like one process run,
[10:45]  but she was telling the output is more.
[10:49]  I will check the input scripts as well.
[10:51]  Again, in UVON and UV2.
[10:54]  It seems fine to me.
[10:56]  It's UV1 table she has used,
[10:59]  but I asked her yesterday,
[11:01]  but I didn't get any update actually.
[11:04]  When have you asked?
[11:05]  Because she replied to my chat yesterday.
[11:09]  There was another thing...
[11:11]  I don't know what to answer on that.
[11:14]  Dutty, you were also there, right?
[11:16]  Sorry, which one?
[11:21]  The Lens e-commerce group chat,
[11:24]  the Ping, David and Jing
[11:27]  that we are facing today.
[11:29]  She said we are facing,
[11:33]  but because of the valid even takes,
[11:36]  now we have one more process to finalize.
[11:44]  What is that one more process?
[11:46]  She is going to tell us,
[11:49]  we already know about this.
[11:51]  What do you know about this?
[11:53]  Now we have one more process to finalize.
[12:00]  She is still...
[12:04]  One more process.
[12:07]  One more script right.
[12:09]  She said one more process.
[12:12]  Is there one more script?
[12:14]  Is there a component or anything?
[12:16]  Yeah, I think this is one script left.
[12:20]  I think yesterday Barko was able to run one script.
[12:23]  There is one more script.
[12:25]  It failed.
[12:26]  It's giving memory out of error again.
[12:28]  I think that...
[12:32]  She told she will execute it from her end
[12:35]  and she will come back,
[12:37]  but after that I asked her input table
[12:39]  she has interpreted.
[12:41]  So what we can do is from her end
[12:43]  there is delay every time
[12:45]  when we tag either David or Elvis
[12:48]  only then she is responding.
[12:50]  So let's have like a recurring
[12:52]  daily connection with her
[12:53]  at least for 15 minutes minimum.
[12:55]  It is going to happen every day.
[12:58]  Like see basically we are facing
[13:00]  a mission grade, either validation
[13:02]  or there is some script changes,
[13:03]  whatever instance that we are using
[13:05]  it's not working.
[13:06]  We will do like a daily stand up
[13:09]  just for topics.
[13:11]  What do you guys say?
[13:15]  Yeah, I think we can do
[13:17]  at least 15 catch up we can schedule
[13:19]  and you know if it is required
[13:21]  we will meet otherwise we will cancel the schedule.
[13:23]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:24]  Yes, yes.
[13:25]  Barko it seems she is available now.
[13:28]  You can ping her and get the details.
[13:30]  Yeah, she is.
[13:31]  She that's what I am saying.
[13:32]  She wasn't...
[13:33]  I think she is responding
[13:36]  like even our time to 130
[13:40]  date.
[13:41]  Yeah, yes.
[13:42]  He is not getting sleep I think
[13:43]  because of his topics.
[13:44]  Yeah, I see.
[13:46]  Here also is what happened
[13:50]  when he comes.
[13:54]  Yeah man Varath.
[13:55]  The first one can you follow up
[13:58]  again when I think
[14:00]  Nikta also replied.
[14:02]  Nikta replied and she
[14:04]  cracked sandcombs already.
[14:06]  What should I do on that?
[14:09]  We need to wait then.
[14:10]  The last one was this
[14:23]  and we are utilizing that one.
[14:24]  The process is taking around 5
[14:39]  days we have running daily.
[14:41]  6 and X we have already
[14:44]  limit in DST.
[14:45]  So it won't fail again
[14:47]  if we change to 16 X.
[14:48]  But yeah we have to
[14:50]  we need to run few times.
[14:51]  The process is taking more than
[14:55]  I can pick the charge and dial it first.
[14:58]  This request is coming
[15:06]  via
[15:08]  David right?
[15:09]  Like Alvaro and David is also
[15:11]  in dupe right?
[15:15]  It's a DST account
[15:16]  mailed by Alvaro right?
[15:17]  Yes.
[15:19]  So who plans to
[15:20]  discuss with Niranjan?
[15:21]  Instant limit.
[15:26]  Instant failure.
[15:27]  Yeah I didn't
[15:28]  check because
[15:29]  since we are reducing
[15:30]  instant failure right?
[15:31]  Since already we have
[15:32]  a limit
[15:33]  if it is working fine
[15:34]  then we can use the
[15:35]  16 X.
[15:36]  Otherwise if we want to
[15:37]  increase then
[15:38]  connect with Niranjan
[15:39]  and see if...
[15:42]  No you mentioned
[15:45]  you are going to
[15:46]  request for another instance also.
[15:48]  Okay.
[15:49]  So only depending on
[15:51]  the need basis
[15:53]  we won't get
[15:54]  cast if you
[16:02]  get the one
[16:03]  we forget one more instance
[16:04]  in slides for DST.
[16:06]  Only if you use
[16:07]  only then we will get
[16:09]  Okay so now
[16:12]  that analysis is done
[16:13]  what next for the story?
[16:15]  I think I am waiting for
[16:18]  changes from the
[16:19]  we need to merge in DST
[16:21]  product and we need to
[16:22]  monitor for few days
[16:26]  then based on the time it is.
[16:30]  Okay it will move to
[16:31]  next print also.
[16:32]  You can close it
[16:34]  I will create a monitor
[16:35]  story in that case
[16:36]  but...
[16:37]  Yeah.
[16:38]  Okay.
[16:39]  You are the...
[16:40]  Water number
[16:48]  36 I've read
[16:50]  with Antonio Prenigar
[16:51]  conflict.
[16:53]  Once he responds I will
[16:55]  update here.
[16:56]  Documentation is complete
[16:58]  I will share it with
[16:59]  me here today
[17:00]  I will share it after
[17:01]  stand up for it.
[17:02]  Now
[17:05]  we had a chat with Antonio
[17:07]  yesterday so
[17:08]  he is not
[17:09]  looking very confident
[17:10]  so make sure we
[17:11]  had this meeting
[17:12]  today.
[17:13]  Yeah.
[17:14]  Right.
[17:15]  Tarun is also there
[17:16]  in that.
[17:17]  Yeah yeah.
[17:18]  Talk.
[17:20]  And for this
[17:21]  Tarun will raise the
[17:22]  ticket and
[17:23]  but
[17:24]  for the rest of the
[17:25]  this is just regarding
[17:27]  only this step
[17:28]  and
[17:29]  yeah
[17:31]  only this step
[17:33]  rest of the things
[17:35]  has been done
[17:36]  have you moved that
[17:37]  yeah.
[17:38]  I made a bit change
[17:39]  no no no
[17:40]  I have not yet moved to be
[17:41]  but this is blocking
[17:42]  move
[17:43]  e-com
[17:44]  one then e-com
[17:47]  and one then
[17:48]  so
[17:49]  only if I get
[17:50]  access to this
[17:51]  I will be able to move
[17:52]  okay.
[18:04]  For 15
[18:05]  output table is created
[18:06]  I will be adding
[18:07]  few more
[18:08]  callings to the table
[18:09]  otherwise it is done
[18:10]  16
[18:11]  I have shared the
[18:12]  dashboard for review
[18:13]  with Vivian
[18:14]  she asked me to make
[18:15]  a change this
[18:16]  I will
[18:17]  completed today
[18:18]  and yeah
[18:19]  and also Lens Parts
[18:20]  Info has already moved
[18:21]  to Prada
[18:22]  I moved it yesterday
[18:23]  I will try to
[18:24]  explain it
[18:25]  yeah.
[18:31]  Hey Anirudh
[18:32]  there is
[18:33]  one
[18:34]  replication alert
[18:35]  right for CNA
[18:36]  alert system
[18:37]  from table
[18:38]  it was saying
[18:39]  there was
[18:40]  zero
[18:41]  rows on the table
[18:43]  CNA alert master
[18:44]  yeah
[18:45]  I just saw
[18:46]  no
[18:47]  I will check
[18:48]  I will check
